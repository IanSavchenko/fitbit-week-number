# "Week Number" for Fitbit 
Small (but yet powerfull!) application to show current and past/upcoming week number. 

![Application icon](/resources/icon.png "Application icon")

Install the app on your Fitbit Ionic or Fitbit Versa from [Fitbit Gallery](https://gam.fitbit.com/gallery/app/d33414a8-f309-4438-aeee-d7dbc749420f).

## Development info

This repo is an export from a [Fitbit Studio](https://studio.fitbit.com) project, which is quite limiting,
because it cannot be directly imported back.
So, there are no external dependencies, linters, bundlers and other JS-world 
"must-have"s.
